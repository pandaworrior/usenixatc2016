\section{Conclusion}
\label{ch:por:sect:conclude}
In this paper, we proposed a research direction for building fast and consistent
geo-replicated system that employs a minimal amount of coordination in
order to achieve both invariant preservation and state convergence. 
To this end, we first defined a new generic consistency model called \PRCN, which maps
consistency requirements to fine-grained restrictions over pairs of operations. Second,
we developed a static analysis to infer for a given application
a minimal set of restrictions for ensuring the two previously mentioned properties, in which
no restrictions can be removed or no new restrictions need to be added. Third, we built an efficient
coordination service called \coordtool, which offers two different coordination protocols
suiting for different workloads. Our evaluation of running RUBiS with different
setups shows that the joint work of \PRCN\ and \coordtool\ significantly
improves system performance of geo-replicated systems.
